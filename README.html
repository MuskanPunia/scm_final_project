PROJECT NAME : SOCIAL SHARE BUTTONS 
<br>
<br>
INTRODUCTION : Social share buttons are a ubiquitous feature found on websites, applications, and blogs. These buttons provide a convenient way for users to share content they find interesting or valuable with their social networks, extending the reach of the content beyond its original platform. By integrating social share buttons into your project, you empower users to amplify your content across various social media platforms, increasing visibility, engagement, and potentially driving more traffic to your website or application.
